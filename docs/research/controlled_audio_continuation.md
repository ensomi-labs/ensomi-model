# Scoped timing with complete-row R1 decisions

This research implementation restores the decision boundary between a timing
skeleton and an R1-derived arranger. The typed resource prototype fixed TAP/LN
counts and release identities before R1 ran. That restriction prevented R1 from
reducing an excessive chord or choosing a different release. It is not part of
the [V3 generation contract](../formulation/notation.md).

## Information and decisions

| Component | Inputs | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| H timing | Complete audio, previous H times, scoped controls | Next head-bearing row time |
| Release timing | Complete audio, H/R timing history, H preview, committed LN ages/occupancy, controls | Release-only event time |
| R1 | Direct audio, full row history, exact replay, timing-only preview, scoped controls, candidate consequences | Complete simultaneous row: head count, TAP/LN kinds, release identities and columns |
| Scheduler | Published prefix, head lookahead and R1 feasibility responses | Query order, constrained release timing, publication and future-control revision |

H requires at least one head; it never specifies a chord size. Release-only
events require a nonempty release row. H rows may also close existing holds.
Only actual LN projection feeds the release preference network. Changing TAP
count or layout while preserving H/R times and LN state leaves both skeleton
network inputs unchanged. R1's execution-feasibility response additionally
constrains the release sampler, as described below. The effective release law
therefore need not remain unchanged. There is no typed future count or
source-tail input to R1.

The shared encoder retains the canonical fine Mel branch and full-song coarse
context. Complete audio is available in training and inference. Generated head
lookahead is provisional timing, not committed future rows. Future release times
depend on actual LN decisions and are generated online. BOS uses the learned
empty-history state without a supplied thirty-row seed.

Difficulty, LN fraction and each style attribute use independently owned control
scopes. Their values and known bits reach R1's composition and geometry paths
directly, as well as both timing factors. Missing style remains unspecified.

The inherited main layout head is affine after additive condition injection.
Its [condition–history interaction limit](row_condition_interactions.md) prevents
that path from changing reflected-candidate odds through current audio or
controls alone. Nonlinear routing, composition and frontier paths remain present;
direct input availability does not establish adequate conditional expressiveness.

Experimental `layout_modulation=True` adds a shared feature scale before the
main layout head. It is driven by the existing audio, preview and control
projections and starts at the identity. The other R1 readouts and the two timing
factors retain their existing contexts. The option and its weights are stored
in the checkpoint; it is disabled for older checkpoints and by default.

An experimental `hold_audio_width` adds a shared representation of active LN
origins. Each occupied column retrieves fine and coarse audio at its committed
start, combines it with current audio and `asinh(age_ms/1000)`, and passes those
values through a small shared MLP. The release clock receives a pooled projection
before its hidden activation, allowing interactions with its existing controls;
R1 reads ordered relative-hand views before its composition and layout readouts.
The release projection cannot choose a release subset. H receives no new input.
Absent slots are zero, and zero-initialized output projections preserve the
initial policy. Width zero keeps this branch disabled. A
[matched continuation study](active_ln_audio_cues.md) found a local improvement
in release organization but insufficient overall evidence to select the branch.

Training this branch requires `score_interval(..., encoded_full=...)` with an
explicit complete-song encoding. A held head may precede the local training crop;
clamping its address to that crop would create a training/inference mismatch.
The encoding stays differentiable, and callers may cache it only while its
encoder weights remain frozen. Ordinary queries and hypothetical release waits
both retrieve from actual active starts. Runtime reconstructs the same cues from
full audio and committed LN state, so no future source tail or extra mutable
memory is carried across a fork or control update.

## Complete-row probability and the frontier

R1 internally groups candidates by `(head count, new LN count, release count)`.
A small readout sees audio, R1 context, head preview and controls and assigns
count-family mass. The inherited complete-row scorer supplies relative geometry
inside each family. These are factors of R1's own policy, not skeleton tokens.

For a supported complete row `a` in count family `k(a)`, the final law is

$$
q(a)\propto p_{\rm count}(k(a)\mid X,H,C,K)\,
p_{\rm layout}(a\mid k(a),X,H,C,K)\,
\exp g_{\rm frontier}(H,C,K,a).
$$

The frontier score enters after within-family normalization and before one
normalization over all rows. A four-key row therefore retains its candidate cost
even when it is the only layout in its family. The inherited `frontier2` features
remain an approximate consequence representation; this does not establish a
complete or calibrated V3 gameplay frontier.

The LN proportion uses unbounded learned local preferences and a scoped log-odds
shift within a fixed head-count/release-count group. The group's mass reads the
actual controls. Local all-TAP passages remain possible under a high-LN request.
Empirical head/release recovery preferences compare R1's complete candidates.

The default `ln_conditioning='reference_tilt'` computes those local LN-count
preferences with the LN request replaced by `ln_reference`, then applies the
analytic log-odds shift. The experimental `contextual_tilt` option instead feeds
the actual request into that count readout while retaining the analytic shift.
This lets the explicit type-count path learn interactions between LN request,
audio and history. It adds no parameters or support restrictions and does not
move head-count or layout decisions into H. At fixed weights, head/release-family
mass before the final consequence score is preserved; the consequence score can
still reweight families when their internal type distribution changes.

Unknown LN requests and requests equal to the reference retain the old law.
Old checkpoints omit this option and load as `reference_tilt`; opt-in checkpoints
record it in their probability options. Expressiveness and replay tests do not
establish musical improvement. The [formal failure analysis](native_pattern_failure_analysis_zh.md)
explains the path-specific limitation and the required learning/native comparison.

Optional LN-amount feedback then tilts the resulting distribution inside each
fixed `(head count, release count)` family. It preserves that family's probability
mass and conditional layout odds at fixed new-LN count. The old scalar
object-count correction is not applied to the timing skeleton.

The amount controller remembers a bounded log-odds correction. After committing
`h` heads with `l` new LNs, it updates that correction by `(rho*h-l)/8` and clips
it to `[-2, 2]`. A finite integral state can compensate a persistent preference
bias without requiring persistent proportion error. Projection discards further
accumulated debt at the bound. Its effect is not guaranteed when contextual
preferences exceed the finite correction or a scope contains few heads.
Each effective LN request episode starts with zero correction; difficulty/style
boundaries alone do not reset it. There is no per-row quota, scope-expiry catch-up
or remaining-time input. Learned local all-TAP and LN passages remain possible.
The raw interval scorer returns the neural row law. A training runner using
`sampling.replay_row_scores` instead includes the deployed preferences and this
feedback, reconstructed from the complete factual prefix. The
[joint memory fit](audio_memory_joint_fit.md) uses that latter objective. Removing
the controller from a fitted model can therefore also expose compensation learned
under its training policy; the endpoint's actual scoring procedure must be stated.

This controller adds a preference for prefix balance. For a scope requesting
fraction .5, a valid arrangement of 64 TAP heads followed by 64 LN heads meets
the final amount. The correction nevertheless reaches +2 after the first 32 TAP
heads. Because projection discards further positive debt, it finishes that valid
sequence at -2 rather than zero. No musical requirement says those intermediate
prefixes must already have the final ratio. Contextual neural preferences can
overcome the bias, but finite support does not make it semantically neutral.

An offset is per new LN: at +2, two rows in the same head/release-count family
differing by four LN starts receive a relative factor of $\exp(8)$ before the
shared normalizer. Although the instantaneous head/release-count marginal is
preserved, different LN choices change subsequent occupancy, releases and future
R1 count choices. Whole-trajectory head counts and workload need not be preserved.

The [native qualification entrypoint](gameplay_regression_evaluation.md#executable-native-qualification)
supports a fixed-weight `ln_feedback=false` comparison while retaining direct
controls and the analytic requested-ratio tilt. Compare total amount against
local TAP/LN organization, held occupation and actual recovery at matching H;
separate control ranges and replicate seeds. A lower amount error alone cannot
establish a better controller, and switching it off is not itself a validated
replacement for scope-level control.

The [fixed-weight native ablation](ln_feedback_scope_ablation.md) records the
scope-semantic witness, complete on/off results, inspected passages and remaining
learning questions. It finds that disabling feedback often destabilizes total
LN amount without establishing replicated musical-organization gains.

`sampling.replay_row_scores` reconstructs the default deployed row distribution
for learning from a completed generated trajectory. It replays recovery and LN
feedback from the complete actual prefix, then scores only the requested clock
interval. A scoring partition does not reset feedback or open holds. Callers
remove collator padding before passing neural row scores. The returned CPU
float64 probabilities preserve the native sampler's arithmetic and remain
differentiable back to model weights, including MPS weights. Empty count groups
use finite unused normalizers to avoid undefined backward derivatives.

This reconstruction covers the default recovery/LN policy. Optional object-rate
or response-projection policies need their own reconstruction. Its row-score
gradient is the full parameter-dependent trajectory score only when audio and
both timing factors are frozen and share no trainable parameters with R1.
Unfreezing those factors requires their timing/survival derivatives too. A
generated prefix must be scored with its own actions and state; source next-row
labels do not define a valid target after changing that prefix.
The [whole-chart outcome comparison](outcome_learning_and_control_response.md)
establishes this scoring path and records its unsuccessful initial control fit
and the measured sensitivity to history and difficulty inputs.

For a diagnostic fit restricted to difficulty conditioning,
`difficulty_tuning.tune_difficulty` freezes all parameters except the value,
known bit and independently owned difficulty-clock columns in R1's row-control
projection and first composition affine. Training uses a column parametrization
so weight decay cannot modify the remaining columns. `folded_state_dict` exports
ordinary effective weights through the existing checkpoint schema; inference
gains no module or parameter. Audio, timing and history-cache parameters remain
fixed. A missing difficulty condition supplies zero to all selected features.
This restriction isolates conditional learning; it does not establish adequate
control capacity or chart quality.

`condition_alignment.condition_alignment` compares summed neural row-factor
scores for the same genuine source scope under observed and mismatched controls.
It detaches frozen-reference scores and applies symmetric softplus terms to the
positive and negative relative log probabilities. At initialization its value is
`2 * log(2)`; a shared increase or decrease of both relative scores cannot reduce
it. Callers exclude padding, select compatible negative conditions and retain
each source's own history. The helper adds no inference model. It is a training
proxy described in the [condition-learning investigation](control_condition_learning.md),
not a generated playability score or a guarantee of guidance equivalence.

`outcomes.scoped_difficulty` reads all complete objects whose heads precede a
scope's exclusive end, retaining the full earlier history and real LN tails.
It returns the existing strain proxy and an exclusive dependency boundary after
the last relevant tail. Later unrelated heads cannot change this readout. This
permits conditional outcome gradients to omit decisions after that boundary;
whole-song objectives, such as a global LN request, retain their own horizon.
Neither the proxy nor its future endpoints are causal generator inputs. A
training scope does not create synthetic LN closures.

R1 can additionally receive an audio/control prediction of mean head objects per
second. Its optional finite demand feedback compares that mean with its own
recent committed head count and softly changes complete-row probabilities by
candidate head count. It neither supplies counts to the skeleton nor changes
H timing. At fixed head count, all LN/release/layout odds remain unchanged by
this particular tilt; the subsequent LN feedback preserves the resulting
head/release-count mass. Both mechanisms act inside R1's joint decision.

The nominal mean is not a plan or a difficulty measure. Every H still requires
at least one head, so an overly active skeleton can make a lower head-object
reference unattainable. A timing-rate model would instead need onset-row targets.
The retained demand readout requires the full-audio encoder and per-field control
encoding on which it was fitted. Control revisions rebuild its future reference
while retaining actual count history; there is no expiry quota.

An independent optional H activity readout estimates head-bearing chart rows per
second from the same audio/control representation. It must be fitted to H-row
counts: simultaneous chord members count once and release-only rows count zero.
The object-demand weights are not interchangeable with this readout. Neither
readout identifies acoustic transients; one sound may still support many chart
events, including a sustained jack construction.

The H sampler can compare its own exponentially discounted onset count with the
integrated mean activity and apply a finite native-logit correction. The current
research policy uses a four-second decay, a four-onset pseudocount, gain two and
a correction bounded to `[-2, 2]`. Millisecond timing, the learned local history
modulation and all supported timing patterns remain available. This is a mean
calibration hypothesis, not an exact density target or a stability theorem.
Its sampling ledger counts every provisional H once; scoped lookahead revision
restores that ledger with its timing cache and RNG. R1 materialization never
updates it. The low-rate readout's 500-ms pooling sets its context resolution,
not the output timestamp grid.

The training distinction matters. A layout loss conditioned on a supplied count
group is invariant to an additive group score and cannot calibrate group mass.
The restored joint likelihood supervises R1's count and layout choices together.
Widening the old inference mask alone would leave those scores uncalibrated.

An experimental `count_history_bound` adds a directly supervised prior over
`(head count, release count)`. It reads full audio, timing preview, active LN ages
and scoped controls. The existing full-context composition logits supply a
centered, bounded correction. With bound `B`, this direct correction changes
pairwise group log odds by at most `2B`; a common additive logit offset has no
meaning. Local LN allocation and conditional layout remain expressive and retain
their original history inputs. The prior receives an additional source group
cross-entropy loss; its weight is an explicit training choice.

In this variant, consequence context retains encoded chart history, exact replay,
controls and hypothetical head timing, while removing the direct audio residual.
Audio still conditions the prior, composition and layout. The consequence score
remains a learned preference, not an independently calibrated canonical response.
Its interaction with conditional layouts can change final group mass, so the
composition bound is not a bound on every historical effect in the final row law.

## Feasibility and scoped publication

The research response profile retains HH/RH/HR intervals of 60/50/50 ms. It is an
implementation support choice, not a change to legal V3 rows or a physiological
law. R1 checks candidate transitions against this profile and a finite future
H horizon. The optimistic continuation may close existing LNs and use one TAP per
future H; it verifies existence, not the probability or comfort of that future.

R1/scheduler derives a release window from exact replay and proposed H times.
Simulating one TAP per H on currently closed keys identifies the first H that
requires another key. Its time minus RH is a necessary release deadline; actual
LN ages determine the earliest release. These two bounds constrain the release
sampler without selecting a release identity or a chord. The preference network
still reads only audio, timing history, LN projection and controls.

This coupling is necessary under distinct recovery intervals. Closed keys can
still be recovering from TAPs. An old held key may become usable after an earlier
release, before those TAP keys recover. Counting only unoccupied keys loses that
distinction and can let the sampler wait beyond the last viable release time.
The response is an execution-feasibility projection for this continuation family,
not the full V3 gameplay frontier.

For example, after a row taps two columns, suppose one other column is ready and
the fourth has an older LN. Upcoming H times are 19 and 53 ms later. The ready
column can serve the first; the tapped columns recover only after 60 ms. Releasing
the LN 1–3 ms after the current row makes it usable by the second H under RH=50.
The release window is therefore real despite three columns being unoccupied.
This case occurred in native generation and cannot be repaired by a lower NLL.

A necessary release wait is normalized conditionally on an event by its deadline
in both training and inference. A publication window does not truncate that
normalizer, force a tail or pretend the song ended. All holds close at true audio
termination.

A future control update keeps published rows, fixed empty time and open holds.
Queued H times before its start remain. Timing is also retained through the
published boundary's fixed recovery horizon, 100 ms under this profile: R1 has
already selected published actions against that preview. Remaining H timing is
regenerated. R1 and release timing receive the requested control values at their
actual scoped times; a very near-term request may retain H timing for those
first 100 ms. This preserves feasibility without feeding TAP clocks or chord
counts back into skeleton sampling. The retained timing is a scheduler policy,
not a claim that unpublished rows are committed or that a request is exact.

`ControlledSession` provides `publish_to`, `coverage` and `update_controls` with
the existing `ControlSchedule`/`ControlSpan` interface. The scheduler is an
in-memory research implementation; durable service recovery is not supplied.

## Learning and qualification

Initialization retains compatible full-audio and R1 tensors from the ranked
typed study. The typed mark predictor and typed preview are not copied. Timing,
scope projections and the R1 count readout have explicit initialization records.
The first bounded fit freezes the audio encoder while updating the probability
factors and R1 decision modules. This is an experimental choice, not a permanent
boundary around R1 or audio adaptation.

Each source chart supplies its own continuous eight-second training intervals.
Source-scoped strain/LN controls and original human style scopes remain separate.
The strain label is an offline proxy with complete source endpoints; those
endpoints never enter generated state. Profile-incompatible intervals are
rejected and counted, not edited into new labels. Proposal sampling conditioned
on that rejection need not retain uniform accepted group mass.

Likelihood is a diagnostic for fitting the restored law. Selection still requires
native audio generation, separately evaluated control ranges, actual timing and
action organization, LN articulation, expressive coverage and service latency.
A fixed audio-generated H trace can isolate R1's restored choices, but cannot
replace native qualification of the complete system.

The 2,500-update research checkpoint was evaluated on Zenithfall, Hysteric and
Take with separate whole-song 3-star requests at LN fractions .2 and .7. The
following errors are means over three fixed audio/seed pairs per control cell;
they are not population uncertainty estimates.

| R1 sampling policy | Requested LN fraction | Absolute LN-fraction error | Absolute star error |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Proportional amount feedback | .2 | .0548 | 1.1451 |
| Projected integral amount feedback | .2 | .0017 | 1.0559 |
| Integral feedback plus R1 mean-head reference | .2 | .0017 | .8527 |
| Proportional amount feedback | .7 | .1185 | 1.5868 |
| Projected integral amount feedback | .7 | .0089 | 1.4433 |

The weights, audio and H times were fixed across these sampling comparisons.
Later row/release states differed after changed choices. The checkpoint identity
is SHA-256 `0f1ddfa5b351988fca04246ec080be106855f49b50fb493370c2d5afee1febb8`;
the optional mean-head readout is the separately fitted scoped 2,000-update
demand predictor. These checkpoints and generated maps are local research assets.

Three additional 32-second difficulty/LN overrides produced LN fractions
.7410/.7225/.7126 for requested .7 with integral feedback. They were evaluated
separately from the preceding and restored ranges. A short restored Take range
contained only 34 heads and produced .2941 for requested .2. Longer-range amount
calibration therefore does not establish precise short-range control.

Lens inspection retained overlapping holds, differing release times, TAP passages
and changing chords. Low-difficulty calibration still fails: a dense Zenithfall
crop already contains mostly single-head rows, whereas a Take peak remains
predominantly repeated double groups. An aggregate head count cannot distinguish
these demands. The R1 mean-head reference improved the tested star error by only
.2032, below its .25 expansion criterion, and remains optional. Neither policy
establishes musical alignment, broad style control or final playable quality.

### R1 errors with reference onset times

Supplying only a ranked chart's H timestamps can distinguish an arrangement
failure from a requirement to repair those timestamps. R1 still starts from BOS
and chooses every head, hold, release and column. Three TRAIN charts near 3 stars
were selected for mostly single-head flow, slower chords and LN organization.
Whole-chart source stars and LN fraction supplied controls; style was unspecified.
Every source H was preserved, with native release generation still active.

| Source organization | Source stars | R1 with source H | Full audio-generated H and R1 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Mostly single heads | 2.999 | 4.852 | 4.374 |
| Slower chords | 3.103 | 2.907 | 2.391 |
| LN organization | 3.005 | 3.492 | 2.990 |

These use the 2,500-update checkpoint and integral LN feedback above. The first
case adds 498 heads to the same 783 onsets: mean heads per H rises from 1.100 to
1.736. This establishes an R1 failure at a valid reference cadence. The mixed
other outcomes do not assign a general percentage of system error to either
module. Sources are identified by SHA-256
`258b3ab4648838b33bfd54de0fd07facc88bccbc81ac81a44220a600bffc1e48`,
`720da64ee70d5fd538522bbd9f429a9be8f8a6f198d67b11a2d9b9e70a99eefc` and
`10a65062594dd828bc3533fa43937f0fc99b00da76d65401fdf45ef1347e9207`, respectively.

The bounded composition-prior variant was compared with ordinary continuation
training from those same weights. Both received the identical 2,000 accepted
eight-second draws from 1,399 TRAIN charts over 1,000 updates. Audio and H/release
timing weights remained bitwise unchanged. R1's source row likelihood trained
both arms; the prior arm additionally received group cross-entropy with weight
.25 and used count-history bound one. Model sizes were 4.584M and 4.720M.

For the single-head source, three paired seeds produced 4.635–4.828 stars after
ordinary continuation and 4.333–4.482 with the prior. Mean absolute errors were
1.724 and 1.412; the .312 improvement fell short of the .4 comparison threshold
and .6 absolute-error bound. Chord/LN cases were closer to target, but the prior
was not selected for broader native qualification. Its optional mode remains
disabled by default. The two terminal checkpoint SHA-256 identities are
`3f90dd80c190695e40886ce7c4151177d8d482f2ba8f5fbb214a99e82a20fc80` and
`e1674f8aab1875e293a0522409d500b181b4ff190130ae57e4cd9eb6ee5b6be3`.
Executable source is `b7a6c88e5634b14855410b7af64225848d6b936e`.

The following probability decomposition uses each trajectory's genuine prefix
and exact state at the same reference H times. Values are expected heads per H
for the prior arm's first seed. Source labels are never attached to generated
alternative histories.

| History | Prior alone | After composition | After consequence comparison | After recovery preference |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Source, realized 1.100 | 1.498 | 1.341 | 1.324 | 1.320 |
| Generated, realized 1.610 | 1.500 | 1.637 | 1.637 | 1.611 |

The baseline distribution is already too wide for this source. The bounded
history correction lowers its mean on source history and raises it on generated
history. Consequence comparison does not account for that increase in this case.
The probe separates probability stages, not content-memory effects from every
physical-state effect. A bounded log-odds correction alone therefore does not
establish a suitable generated count distribution.

Lens action tables and time-proportional images show the practical difference:
77–78-ms single-note flow becomes frequent doubles and triples. Ordinary
continuation also sustains alternating two-key groups through a dense passage.
The chord source still yields changing chords and single-note transitions.
For the LN source, the prior's median hold duration is 146 ms against 222 ms in
the source; 14.9% of its holds last at most 80 ms, against none in the source.
Overlapping holds remain, but short isolated tails replace many longer cross-row
relationships. Near-target stars in that case do not establish equivalent LN
organization or playability.

The subsequent [causal response control study](causal_response_control.md)
compares fixed penalties with a probability projection on R1's actual generated
press history. It improves the tested low-LN difficulty errors, while exposing
remaining high-LN, timing-floor and short-scope control failures.
