# Chart and generation contract

Ensomi generates a 4-key chart from complete source audio. This page defines
its row language, legal continuations, committed-prefix semantics, the
generation and property-query interfaces, and the
[decomposed problem](#decomposed-problem-given-head-times) in which the head
times are given.
[Gameplay state](gameplay-state.md) defines the target gameplay response,
frontier, style observations, demand requests, and their use in generation.
[Style conditions and control](style-conditions-and-control.md) defines the
chart identity, scoped requests, and chart properties.

## Chart object and time

Let $A$ be the complete source audio, $T$ its duration in seconds, and
$X=\Phi(A)$ an audio representation available before generation begins.
The representation and model architecture are open choices.

A materialized chart is a finite ordered sequence

$$
H=((t_1,m_1),\ldots,(t_N,m_N)),
\qquad N\geq 0,
$$

where $t_i\in[0,T]$ is an absolute audio timestamp and $m_i$ is one complete
nonempty four-lane row. Row times are strictly increasing:

$$
t_1<t_2<\cdots<t_N.
$$

All simultaneous lane actions belong to the same row. Internal beat coordinates,
time-shift tokens, lattices, and relative offsets must resolve to this chart
object. The formulation imposes no additional minimum spacing between rows.

## Row language and long notes

Serialized lane order is always $(1,2,3,4)$. Each lane has one action per row:

| Code | Action | Legal occupancy transition |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| $0$ | `EMPTY` | closed $\to$ closed or open $\to$ open |
| $1$ | `TAP` | closed $\to$ closed |
| $2$ | `LN_START` | closed $\to$ open |
| $3$ | `LN_CLOSE` | open $\to$ closed |

Every other action-occupancy combination is illegal. In particular, `EMPTY`
preserves an open long note; it is not a release.

The row alphabet is

$$
\mathcal M=\{0,1,2,3\}^4\setminus\{(0,0,0,0)\}.
$$

The four actions in a row are simultaneous. A row can contain only one action
on each lane, so the language does not represent a same-lane close and restart
at the same timestamp. Strictly ordered rows also exclude zero-duration long
notes.

A complete chart starts with every lane closed and closes every long note by
$T$. Closure requires a materialized `LN_CLOSE`; song end does not implicitly
release open lanes. An intermediate chart prefix may retain open long notes.

A planning representation may encode the absence of an entire row. That
absence must remain distinct from `EMPTY` on one lane, and it must not insert a
$(0,0,0,0)$ row into the materialized chart. Its internal encoding is an
implementation choice.

## Canonical hand-role coordinates

The canonical mapping assigns two roles to each hand:

| Lane | Hand | Role |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| $1$ | left | outer |
| $2$ | left | inner |
| $3$ | right | inner |
| $4$ | right | outer |

For $m=(m_1,m_2,m_3,m_4)$, its hand-role view is

$$
\operatorname{Act}_{\lambda}(m)
=
\bigl((m_1,m_2),(m_4,m_3)\bigr).
$$

Each hand uses $(\mathrm{outer},\mathrm{inner})$ order. Concatenating these
pairs directly would produce $(1,2,4,3)$ rather than serialized lane order.
This is a deterministic coordinate projection, not inferred fingering or a
separate physical execution. A two-role chord activates both roles; it does
not create uncertainty over which role was used.

The left-right mirror is

$$
\mu(m_1,m_2,m_3,m_4)=(m_4,m_3,m_2,m_1).
$$

Apply it to each chart row without changing timestamps. It exchanges hands
while preserving outer and inner roles. Gameplay response and style symmetry
are specified in [gameplay-state.md](gameplay-state.md).

## Committed history and exact replay

During generation, $H$ denotes the committed chart prefix. Its semantic state
is the pair

$$
(H,g),
$$

where $g$ is the fixed-through time. Every row in $H$ has time at or before
$g$, and no further row may be inserted at or before $g$. Thus $g$ fixes both
row and no-row decisions. Advancing it need not add a row to $H$.

Initially $H=()$ and all lanes are closed. Use the formal boundary $g=0^-$
when the decision at time $0$ is still open. The sentinel precedes $0$ in the
ordering; it is not a negative audio timestamp. The interval $(0^-,e]$ denotes
$[0,e]$, so rows at time $0$ remain representable.

A committed prefix must replay legally from the initial closed occupancy. At
$g=T$, it must also satisfy the complete-chart closure requirement.

A caller may supply a prefix: an initial committed pair $(H_0,g_0)$ in place
of $((),0^-)$. It must satisfy the same requirements: every row of $H_0$ has
time at or before $g_0$, and $H_0$ replays legally from the initial closed
occupancy. Its rows and no-row decisions through $g_0$ are committed;
continuation preserves them and inherits any long notes open at $g_0$, with
the obligation to close them by $T$. A supplied prefix is committed history
and nothing else. It is not a request, and it is not by definition evidence
for the chart identity;
[Identity and prefix](style-conditions-and-control.md#identity-and-prefix)
states how the two relate.

Exact state is derived by replay:

$$
x_H(t)=\operatorname{Replay}(H;t).
$$

Replay processes all rows with timestamp at or before $t$. Its required
format information is lane-wise long-note occupancy:

$$
\omega_H(t)\in\{0,1\}^4.
$$

An implementation may also derive exact chart summaries such as action clocks.
These remain functions of chart history and query time. They do not require a
separate committed control-memory object. Occupancy changes only at rows;
time-dependent summaries must also advance through intervals without rows.

At a row time $t$, $x_H(t^-)$ denotes the state before that row and $x_H(t)$
the state after the complete row. For a committed boundary, $x_H(g)$ therefore
includes any row at $g$.

The pair $(H,g)$ is the source of truth for the chart. Retained replay caches
must agree with it, but they are not additional independent semantic state.
Exact replay summaries need not contain every arrangement distinction in the
full history; the history remains available to generation. The chart identity
and request set of [Generation and optional controls](#generation-and-optional-controls)
are generation inputs retained across calls, not chart state: they are neither
stored in $(H,g)$ nor derived from it.

## Legal continuations

For a committed boundary $(H,g)$, choose a generation window

$$
W=(g,e],
\qquad g<e\leq T.
$$

A continuation is a finite sequence

$$
Y_W=((\tau_1,n_1),\ldots,(\tau_M,n_M)),
\qquad M\geq 0.
$$

Write $\mathcal V_{\mathrm{legal}}(H,g,e)$ for the set of continuations that
satisfy all of the following:

1. Every row time lies in $W\cap[0,T]$, and row times are strictly increasing.
2. Every $n_i\in\mathcal M$.
3. Replay from the boundary occupancy accepts every row under the transition
   table.
4. If $e=T$, every lane is closed after the last row and remains closed at $T$.

Appending a continuation leaves $H$ and its fixed no-row decisions unchanged.
The empty continuation $Y_W=()$ is legal at an intermediate horizon, including
when long notes remain open. At song end it is legal only if the boundary has
no open long notes. Once $g=T$, generation is complete and there is no further
window to generate.

Local row legality and complete-chart legality differ at song end. An
`LN_START` on a closed lane at $T$ satisfies the local occupancy transition,
but cannot belong to a legal completed chart because there is no later time
for its close. A required `LN_CLOSE` at $T$ can be legal.

These rules define chart legality. Audio correspondence, gameplay demand,
style, chart-property targets, model probability, and decoding support affect
generation choices; they do not change the legal continuation set.

## Generation and optional controls

The generated object is the complete row continuation. A probabilistic
formulation is

$$
Y_W\sim p_\theta\left(
\cdot\mid X,H,g,W,\rho,\mathscr U,
[c_W^{\mathrm{demand}}]
\right),
$$

with probability one on $\mathcal V_{\mathrm{legal}}(H,g,e)$. Brackets mark an
optional argument. The inputs after $W$ have different meanings:

- $\rho$ is the chart identity: the whole-chart choice that the music, any
  given head times and the requests leave open, held across the song. It is
  always in effect: a caller may supply it, and otherwise the system
  establishes one at the first generation call. It is retained across
  continuation calls and changes only by an explicit update at a committed
  boundary.
- $\mathscr U$ is the finite, possibly empty, set of scoped requests. A request
  has a scope in song time, independent of $W$, and carries a style directive,
  a set of chart-property targets, or both, with a policy for transitions and
  priority. A request is valid only if it is added while the committed
  boundary precedes the start of its scope.
- $c_W^{\mathrm{demand}}$ expresses requested gameplay-demand responses under a
  declared response specification.

[Style conditions and control](style-conditions-and-control.md) defines $\rho$ and
$\mathscr U$; [Controls](gameplay-state.md#controls) defines demand requests.
The [decomposed problem](#decomposed-problem-given-head-times) adds given head
times and a beat grid to these inputs. With $\mathscr U$ empty and no demand
request, generation is
[natural continuation](style-conditions-and-control.md#natural-continuation)
under the identity, with every chart property free. It still produces a chart
with realized gameplay organization and demand.

Neither the identity nor any request fixes a row or overrides committed
decisions and long-note obligations. Requests may conflict with each other or
be unattainable under the committed boundary, given head times, and
implementation support. Generation may seek a legal compromise or report that
a request cannot be met;
[Overlap and priority](style-conditions-and-control.md#overlap-and-priority) defines which overlapping
requests are invalid, how the others compose, and how a shortfall is
declared. This notation does not assume numerical demand coordinates, a style
score scale, or a style or identity representation.

A property query reads a chart $\bar H$ over a scope $S$:

$$
\mathsf{Properties}_\nu(\bar H,S)
=
\bigl(
\operatorname{LNShare}_\nu(\bar H,S),
\operatorname{Difficulty}_\nu(\bar H,S),
\ldots
\bigr).
$$

$\bar H$ may be a complete chart, a committed prefix, or a committed prefix
extended by a provisional continuation, and $\nu$ declares the measurement
semantics. The query depends only on chart content and $\nu$; it has no
request argument. Property targets in $\mathscr U$ use the same definitions.
A readout of a provisional branch is computed on that branch and does not
become a committed fact.
[Chart properties and measurement semantics](style-conditions-and-control.md#chart-properties-and-measurement-semantics)
states what $\nu$ must declare.

The [target response and frontier](gameplay-state.md#target-response-and-frontier)
come before a proposed demand representation $d$ in the semantic definition.
Once a response specification exists, such a representation may provide derived
features for generation or evaluation. This page requires neither a particular
representation nor a runtime demand-state input. Concrete response definitions
and their relation to [style observations](gameplay-state.md#style-observations)
belong to the gameplay formulation.

Complete audio is available during generation. Models may jointly reason about
provisional future rows, including later rows in the same continuation. Those
rows cannot be treated as already committed history. Planning tokens, edits,
response representations, and search branches become chart history only through
their selected materialized rows.

The probability model must account for variable-length timed sequences. A
continuous-time formulation needs a declared probability measure or equivalent
construction; normalization by a finite sum applies only to finite support.
The formulation does not prescribe an energy score, partition function,
factorization, or decoding algorithm.

## Provisional branches and prefix commit

A proposal branch extends the same committed pair $(H,g)$ and may compute its
own provisional replay and gameplay responses. Neither the branch nor its
caches may mutate committed rows, the fixed-through time, or committed caches.
This is a semantic isolation requirement, not a requirement to copy the full
history into each branch.

Select a legal continuation $Y_W$ and a boundary

$$
g<g'\leq e.
$$

Committing through $g'$ fixes every row and no-row decision in $(g,g']$.
Writing $Y_W|_{(g,g']}$ for the selected rows in that interval, the update is

$$
(H,g)
\longrightarrow
\left(H\mathbin{\|}Y_W|_{(g,g']},g'\right),
$$

where $\mathbin{\|}$ denotes ordered concatenation. Rows exactly at $g'$ are
included; rows at the old boundary $g$ cannot be added or changed. A branch
defined only through $e$ cannot commit decisions beyond $e$.

The committed history and boundary advance together. Any published derived
cache must describe the new pair, or be invalidated and recomputed. Losing
branches and the uncommitted suffix remain provisional. The choice of prefix
and the confidence needed to select it are implementation questions.

A commit with no rows still advances $g$. It preserves any open long-note
occupancy and advances time-dependent derived quantities. An interval without
rows can contain sustained holds; it does not necessarily represent rest or
imply decreasing demand.

Committing `LN_START` commits an open lane and the obligation to close it by
song end. A proposed `LN_CLOSE` beyond $g'$ is still provisional and may move.
The generator may not erase the committed start, release it implicitly, or
reinterpret an absent closing opportunity as chart illegality.

## Legal space and implementation support

A concrete timing representation, candidate proposal, tokenization, or decoder
may reach only a subset of $\mathcal V_{\mathrm{legal}}(H,g,e)$. A legal
continuation omitted by that subset is an implementation support limitation.
In particular, an implementation can leave itself without a reachable closing
row even though the chart language permits one.

The formulation does not require a candidate stage or prescribe its inputs,
refresh policy, or internal timing paths. Taking the head times as given is
not a support limitation of this kind: it changes the problem, and
[Decomposed problem: given head times](#decomposed-problem-given-head-times)
defines the resulting legal set.

## Worked example

Let $T>30.20$ and suppose the committed history is

$$
H=\bigl((29.70,(0,0,2,0)),(29.90,(0,1,0,0))\bigr),
\qquad g=29.90.
$$

Lane 3 is open: the first row starts a long note, and the second row leaves
that lane unchanged. For $W=(29.90,30.20]$:

- A row $(30.00,(0,0,3,0))$ legally closes lane 3.
- A row $(30.00,(0,0,2,0))$ illegally starts another long note on lane 3.
- A row $(30.00,(0,0,0,1))$ legally taps lane 4 while lane 3 remains open.

The third continuation is legal because the horizon is intermediate. If its
endpoint were song end, a later row closing lane 3 would be required within
that same window. Neither the identity nor any request can make the second
continuation legal.

Choosing $Y_W=()$ and committing through $30.05$ leaves $H$ unchanged, fixes
no-row decisions through $30.05$, and keeps lane 3 open. Its eventual close
must occur after $30.05$ and no later than $T$.

## Decomposed problem: given head times

In the full problem, generation places every row: it chooses the row times as
well as their contents. The decomposed problem takes the times of the head
rows as given and generates the arrangement on them. Ensomi's generation is
posed on the decomposed problem; the full problem, in which the head times are
generated as well, remains the target. The decomposition changes what is
given, not the chart language or its legality.

### Head times and the decomposed legal set

A row is a **head row** if it contains at least one `TAP` or `LN_START`. Every
other row is a **close-only row**: its non-`EMPTY` actions are all `LN_CLOSE`.
For a chart, prefix, or continuation $\bar H$, write $\operatorname{Heads}(\bar H)$
for the set of its head-row times.

The decomposed problem receives two further inputs. Both cover the whole song
and, like the audio, are available to every generation call:

- a finite set of head times
  $\mathcal T_{\mathrm h}=\{s_1<\cdots<s_K\}\subset[0,T]$;
- a beat grid $\Gamma$, a tempo and phase over the song, to which release
  times refer. Its positions form a finite set $P_\Gamma\subset[0,T]$, and
  close-only rows lie at these positions.

A solution is a legal complete chart whose head rows lie exactly at
$\mathcal T_{\mathrm h}$ and whose close-only rows lie in $P_\Gamma$.
Close-only rows can fall at times that are not head times. For a
committed boundary $(H,g)$ and window $W=(g,e]$, the decomposed legal set is

$$
\mathcal V_{\mathrm{legal}}(H,g,e;\mathcal T_{\mathrm h},\Gamma)
=
\bigl\{
Y_W\in\mathcal V_{\mathrm{legal}}(H,g,e):
\operatorname{Heads}(Y_W)=\mathcal T_{\mathrm h}\cap W,
\quad
\text{every close-only row of }Y_W\text{ lies in }P_\Gamma
\bigr\}.
$$

The committed history satisfies
$\operatorname{Heads}(H)=\mathcal T_{\mathrm h}\cap(0^-,g]$. Prefix commits
preserve this, and a supplied prefix must satisfy it at $g_0$.

Every head time in $W$ needs a head row, so the empty continuation is legal
only for a window that contains no head time. Because `TAP` and `LN_START` act
only on closed lanes, a head row at $s$ requires at least one lane closed at
$s^-$: a continuation that reaches a head time with all four lanes open cannot
place its head row.

The decomposed generation law is

$$
Y_W\sim p_\theta\left(
\cdot\mid X,H,g,W,\mathcal T_{\mathrm h},\Gamma,\rho,\mathscr U,
[c_W^{\mathrm{demand}}]
\right),
$$

with probability one on
$\mathcal V_{\mathrm{legal}}(H,g,e;\mathcal T_{\mathrm h},\Gamma)$. The other
inputs keep their meanings from
[Generation and optional controls](#generation-and-optional-controls); the
audio remains an input. Legal charts with other head times lie outside the
decomposed problem.

### Why this decomposition

- Head times are largely a property of the music. Generating them is a timing
  problem that can be posed from audio separately.
- The arrangement given the head times is where choreography, hand roles, and
  most of the [chart identity](style-conditions-and-control.md#chart-identity)
  live.
- With the head times given, the legal arrangements at each row form a finite
  set, and a training target taken from a human chart has no timing error.

### Consequences of given head times

Taking the head times as given constrains what the arrangement can attain:

- When the head times come from an existing chart, they carry that chart's
  properties that they fix. A target is attainable only within what they leave
  open, and the chart identity governs only that open part.
- When the head times are generated, the chart identity and the property
  requests must reach the generation of the head times, because the head times
  carry part of what those inputs specify.

### Assumptions

The decomposition rests on three assumptions. Here the rows are the head rows at
the head times.

1. **Raw audio decides the rows.** The head times follow from the audio, so
   generating them is a timing problem that can be posed from audio.
2. **The rows give enough for choreography and control.** The head times fix
   enough of the chart for the arrangement on them to be choreographed and
   controlled.
3. **Separating the concerns lets the arrangement stage achieve some things
   without the others.** The arrangement stage can meet some generation targets
   without the generation of the head times, and without audio.

The evidence on these assumptions is recorded in
[Head-time decomposition](../research/head_time_decomposition.md).
