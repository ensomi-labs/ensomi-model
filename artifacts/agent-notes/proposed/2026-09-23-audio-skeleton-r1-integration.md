# Agent Note: Audio skeleton generation and R1 integration

Note ID: 2026-09-23-audio-skeleton-r1-integration
Status: proposed
Kind: research
Created: 2026-09-23
Updated: 2026-09-23
Product revision: 5c56e28bbf1ab92abaa0436b33c0d33a6c30eead
Scope: Released R1 sensitivity to candidate timing; audio-conditioned skeleton learning and downstream integration
Related: 2026-09-20-r1-response-recovery-handoff

## Question and authority

Can an audio-conditioned model provide head times and release opportunities that
support playable generation with the released R1, adapting either model when
evidence warrants it? Complete source audio is available. The client protocol
supports incremental LN delivery; resolving a future tail before publishing its
head is not a requirement.

On 2026-09-23 the human owner explicitly authorized implementation, local
experiments, architecture iteration, training and joint optimization with R1 on
the available Mac, including overnight compute after small experiments. This
standing execution authority supersedes a separate approval before each local
experiment. It does not imply Note acceptance, remote publication, modification
of human annotations or a claim that a candidate is playable. Cards remain
proposed and results are exploratory until independently supported.

The existing orphan notes ref is attached to a dedicated worktree for research
persistence. Product implementation is on `codex/audio-skeleton`. The notes ref
is not merged into the product branch.

## Baseline and observations

- Release tag: `r1-restored-6.75m`, source
  `8f1310322ba1f64a1ca259893e76376daf36396e`.
- Model repository: `sed-i/pulsefield-r1-restored`, revision
  `0cf786c2018d769af8edf1afadc6cfd163eed5e4`.
- Checkpoint SHA-256:
  `4b3ec1561e33d0ebe2756cfe13571ec414fd5bb470b430f0c578545863115f70`.
- The 3,084,432-parameter restored model is distinct from the historical deleted
  response model. Historical quality measurements cannot serve as its baseline.
- Production seeds cover the complete row reaching 30 heads. H requires heads;
  R permits releases. Timing inputs include whole-schedule summaries. Start with
  a complete fixed schedule and preserve the supplied seed for causal isolation.
- Runtime: Apple M5, 10 CPU cores, 24 GiB unified memory, macOS 27.0,
  Python 3.10.20, Torch 2.11.0, BeatThis 1.1.0, MPS available.
- Available corpus: pinned catalog
  `artifacts/oracle-time-review/20260915-adfb1ee/catalog.json`, SHA-256
  `e31b7e8f4daa044503ef2b8411bc41727ba371eec804c9462a4608be8112ad28`,
  and admitted rows at `artifacts/oracle-time-continuation/full-cache-v1`.

## Architecture alternatives

The proposed skeleton model combines a local audio timing encoder with optional
frozen BeatThis contextual features. Separate heads predict required head times,
release-only opportunities and sub-frame offsets. A declared chart-level density
condition distinguishes different arrangements for the same music. Source-derived
conditioning used in validation must be labeled as supplied control information,
not audio-only prediction. A train-derived default condition is evaluated separately.

The first comparison is local audio features alone versus additional frozen
BeatThis features with matched training data and budgets. Fine-tuning the audio
encoder, autoregressive rhythmic planning and R1 adaptation remain evidence-driven
follow-ups. The sparse independent release target must not be replaced by a dense
grid without measuring the resulting R1 distribution shift.

Closest analogues: [BeatThis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21658) provides contextual
beat representations, but predicts beats/downbeats rather than chart events;
[Dance Dance Convolution](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/donahue17a.html)
separates chart timing from placement and conditions timing on difficulty. The
combination is an adaptation; no new architecture or research novelty is claimed.

## Experiment Card: audio-skeleton-r1-support

### Identity and authority

- Owning Note: `2026-09-23-audio-skeleton-r1-integration`.
- Card ID: `audio-skeleton-r1-support`; revision: 1.
- Execution authority: explicit human authorization above; acceptance: none.

### Comparison

- Question: Does increasing non-head opportunities materially change native R1
  holds, independent of head timing and seed quality?
- Baseline source: the clean product revision above; baseline checkpoint as pinned.
- Baseline value: not previously measured for this release. Establish it using
  the same cohort and runner before interpreting paired interventions.
- Selection: deterministic source-only song-group selection, seed 20260923,
  validation strata by head-row density below 4, 4–8, and at least 8 per second,
  crossed with source LN-head fraction below/at least 0.1. Two distinct groups
  per available stratum, full charts lasting 60–360 seconds with a suffix.
  Freeze exact selected source/cache identities in a manifest before generation.
- Intervention: insert one midpoint non-head candidate in respectively one in
  four or every eligible post-seed original candidate gap. Do not change H,
  original R, the real terminal, seed rows, or crossing-LN endpoint timestamps.
  Remap crossing candidate indices. Only gaps at least 20 ms are eligible.
- Paired generation seeds: 17 and 23. Same released parameters and temperature 1.
- Primary diagnostic: per-chart suffix-born LN median-duration ratio relative
  to baseline, then median across paired charts where both have LNs.
- Triage threshold: more than 20% median shift, or at least three charts shifting
  over 40%, triggers candidate-distribution adaptation investigation. Thresholds
  are engineering triage choices, not playability or statistical significance.
- Guards: every output independently legal with H coverage, unchanged seed and
  known endpoints, and exact export/reparse; no failed case silently excluded.
- Additional measurements: LN quantity, release-only rows, concurrent-hold
  exposure, sharp same-lane gaps, full-chart generation cost and per-step latency.
- Qualitative check: inspect worst changed LN passages and density transitions;
  neither aggregate duration nor LN amount establishes retained organization.
- Bounds: 45 minutes for the small sensitivity suite, up to four CPU workers
  with one Torch thread each, 18 GiB aggregate process memory, 40 GiB free disk
  reserve. Outputs under fresh `artifacts/audio-skeleton/20260923-v1/` owners.
- Stop: changed input digest, illegal output, nonfinite state, explicit pause,
  memory/resource pressure or time limit. Preserve failed outputs and reasons.
- Confounders: inserted decisions change RNG consumption; paired seed alone
  does not couple every subsequent draw. Report multiple seeds and trajectory
  differences. Whole-schedule features also change; this is total sensitivity
  to added opportunities, not isolation of release hazard alone.
- Positive/negative interpretation: stability supports a subsequent predicted
  skeleton probe; instability supports adaptation or better candidate selection.
  Neither outcome establishes musical alignment or final playability.

## Next work and completion conditions

Record source commits, dataset/feature manifests and run results before training
comparisons. Preserve song groups and quarantine exact audio duplicates across
training and validation. TEST payloads remain unopened. Keep the original R1
fixed for timing comparisons, then evaluate targeted R1 adaptation if necessary.
Train a small learning check before a larger run. Evaluate native generated
charts, opening compatibility, playback buffer costs and player-facing quality
before claiming a final playable system.
